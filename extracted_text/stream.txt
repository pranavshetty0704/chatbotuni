The Computer Science & Engineering ( Data Science)Department is established in the year 2019. 
Having started with a four-year undergraduate program, B. E. (CSE -DS), the department is willing
to start the Post Graduate Program, M. E. CSE-DS with specializations, shortly in coming days.
Data Science is a field of Scientific theories where Unstructured, Raw data is taken and moulded
into meaningful information by means of Programming, Business skills, and Analytics. Many
Multinational Companies across the globe are using Digital methods to Rationalize their work and
Maintaining their Inventory. This Technological advancement helps in various factors like Cost
Saving, Resource Saving, and Time-Saving. The concept of Data science consists of various
components or sub building units that help to segregate or segment data using calculus and
algorithms, it?s a time-saving process. The data can be either in structured form or unstructured
form, the structured form data can be in form of a tabular form or Excel sheets, etc whereas the
unstructured form of data can be Images, audios, videos, pdf files, etc DML Data ManipulationScraped Data
Language is used to Manipulate and Extract meaningful data out of junk. Until and unless the Data
Scientists don?t have a good knowledge about statistics and Probability, they are not capable of
segmenting data, it may lead to the high possibility of misinterpreting data and reaching to the
incorrect conclusions. The Data Scientists have to work over the algorithms of Machine learning in
day-to-day life. The regression and Classification concepts help the Data scientists to predict the
valuable insights from all the Unstructured or structured form of Data available. The concept of Big
Data helps to extract the main information out of all the possible raw data available. Like we can
separate oil from water. The Data Scientist uses various concepts and skills to extract data like
JAVA, R, Apache Spark, Hadoop Etc.Thus, there are many more components of data science
available and every component works on different algorithms.Skills Required for Data Science

WranglingData Visualization & CommunicationSoftware EngineeringData IntuitionSome of the
prominent data science roles are listed below :Data ScientistA Data Scientist?s primary job role is to
extract consumable information from structured and unstructured data with computer programming
tools and processes. Their job also includes creating methodology and blueprint to present
information to stakeholders. They are also supposed to maintain databases.Data AnalystA Data
Analyst has the responsibility of analyzing the data, identifying trends, and creating a predictive
model based on data studied. Another critical responsibility of a Data Analyst is to translate findings
into reports, which can be understood by the management, and help them accurately visualize the
possible outcome. They are also supposed to maintain databases and data systems.Data
EngineerData Engineers are required to study data, develop data set processes, prepare the
predictive model, and build algorithms through which stakeholders can easily consume raw data. It
may include developing dashboards and reports that can be accessed and used by all stakeholders.
Data Engineers need to have strong communication skills to be able to understand client?sScraped Data
requirements and objectives.
 Analysts predict that the country will have more than 11 million job openings by 2026. In fact, since
2019, hiring in the data science industry has increased by 46%. Yet, around 93,000 jobs in Data
Science were vacant at the end of August 2020 in India.Data Mining EngineerThe job of a Data
Mining Engineer is mainly extracting data from an extensive database and analyzing them. They are
also responsible for building and maintaining software and digital infrastructure to study big chunks
of data.Data ArchitectData Architect?s role is to ensure that data used in creating a blueprint of a
project is stable, secure, and available to all stakeholders at all times. The job role includes collating,
organizing, centralizing, maintaining, and protecting a company or client?s data.Data StatisticianThis
job role includes critical responsibilities such as extraction of data using statistical methodologies
and analyzing, organizing, and contextualizing data and its subsets. A Data Statistician is supposed
to conduct tests to determine the reliability and accuracy of data.Project ManagerData mining,
extraction, testing, analysis, and application for creating a blueprint is a wide field of work that
requires management to optimize the resources being used on a project. A Project Manager?s role
is to oversee and guide the execution of the project. They act as a medium between the team and
clients to communicate requirements and changes in the project.
