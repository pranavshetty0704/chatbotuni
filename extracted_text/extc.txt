ObjectivesETA (Electronics and Telecommunication engineer?s Association) is a literature
committee of EXTC department. It provides a platform for the students to stay updated with present
and future technology. ETA provides good opportunities to students in bringing out their talents
related to writing, editing while promoting the habit of research. A key focus on the habit of research,
as students? research for advancement in various technological sectors, we believe the exposure
they receive because of this could ultimately help them make a more informed decision about their
post graduate journey.NewsletterAcademic Year 2023-24Newsletter 1Academic Year
