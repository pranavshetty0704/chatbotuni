Team Airnova is the official Aeronautics & Aerospace team of Vidyavardhini?s College of
Engineering & Technology; the main motto of the team is to spread awareness about Technological
advancements in the Aviation and Spacecraft sector. The team was established in 2019 and made
an official part of the college in 2020. Since then, despite the lockdown, Team Airnova has been
conducting research on RC Aircrafts, UAVs and Spacecrafts. The team functions under the
guidance of our faculty in-charge Prof. Apurva Pendbhaje and along with them has had support from
our other college faculties.The team provides a platform for all engineering students to come
together and design, manufacture RC Aircrafts and UAVs to participate in competitions regarding
the designing of UAVs & Aircrafts that can be implemented in the industry with regards to recent
developments. Despite having a lockdown imposed post the formation, the team has participated in
several competitions in this time.Scraped Data

new methods of fabricating UAVs.To design an electrically sound propulsion system to lessen the
impact on the environment.
Objectives :
Aerodominator 7.0 2020:Aerodominator 7.0 is a national level aero design competition brought to
you by SAE-VIT. This micro class aero design competition has the main aim of designing and
manufacturing an aircraft capable of carrying high payloads within a set of constraints.MSSA?s
IPASC 2021:The International Planetary Aerial Systems (IPAS) Challenge is a competition for
university students to design a Mars Aerial System (Vehicle) which shall be fully equipped and
mission ready for Operation on Mars. Teams are supposed to carefully plan each subsystem of the
Aerial System considering various extra-terrestrial parameters in design (Exceptions if any shall be
mentioned). This competition is designed for students to explore their mind and spark the innovative
design thinking of Individuals without putting any constraints on available physical resources.
Students are encouraged to be as imaginative, creative and insightful as possible within practical
implementable limits for the human race.AirnovaAirnovaAirnovaAerodominator 7.0 (virtual)
