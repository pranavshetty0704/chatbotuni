Dr. Ajay Sudhir RadkeA warm welcome to the Civil Engineering department. The department of the
Civil engineering is established in the 2013 in the Vidyavardhini?s College of Engineering and
Technology. The Civil Engineering department aims a topmost Institution by generating professional
with higher degree of technical knowledge, proficient skills and principled values. The Department of
Civil Engineering along with its multi-layered faculty sustains its robust relations with the industry
and other institutes by organizing various events such as Product Showcase and Vidyavardhini?s
National Project Showcase (VNPS). The students are always invigorated to participate
extra-curricular and co-curricular events which are essential for the building a team spirit and
development of administrative skills results in their personality development. I believe that the
students of the department would rationalize the reliability of the department by presenting a
extraordinary level of proficient ability in their corresponding job areas.Scraped Data
