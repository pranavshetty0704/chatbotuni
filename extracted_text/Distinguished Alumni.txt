ValuersTestimnoialsI am Ashutosh Lopes. I have completed my graduation from Vidyavardini?s
College of engineering and technology in Civil Engineering and currently I am pursuing Post
Graduation Program in Project engineering management from National Institute of Construction
Management and Research During my college days I was involved in various extracurricular
activities. I served as a General Secretary during the year 2019 and was also part of CESA
committee. As rightly said that Professor can change lives with just right mix of chalk and
challenges, and yes civil department faculty never failed to give their student right amount of
knowledge as well as care and support throughout the span of 4 years Talking about college
infrastructure it provides lots of amenities to student which help them to grow in technical as well as
in professional way. VCET is not just a college for me, it is family for me. I am glad and honored to
be a part of this organization.
