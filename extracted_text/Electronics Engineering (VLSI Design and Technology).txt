reaccredited fromJuly 2022 to June 2025and is permanently affiliated to University of Mumbai.
The department is equipped with the state-of-the-art laboratories with advance equipment and
recent software for academic studies and research along with industry labs set up by Texas
Instruments. Highly qualified and experienced faculty members (more than 15 years) are the
greatest asset to the department. To make the teaching-learning process interesting and interactive
the faculty uses various instructional pedagogies, innovative techniques, and ICT tools.
Department is also associated with international and national students? chapters like IEEE and
IETE.  Department in association with student chapters, regularly conducts various activities on
emerging technology trends. The department strives for all round development of the students by
implementing Outcome Based Education systems with regular focus on extra-curricular activities like
sports, cultural events, and technical events along with academic schedule.
Department has signed MOUs with 12 industries, enhancing placement support, and fostering
career growth of students. The Department encourages industry projects, Internships and organizes
industrial visits with the aim of providing practical learning opportunities essential for student
development and allowing to experience the working environment and gain awareness of industryScraped Data
standards. The consistent placements in renowned national and international Companies have
