Dr. Uday AswalekarHead Of DepartmentEstablished in 1994, the Department of Mechanical
Engineering is amongst the premier Departments of VCET. Currently, it is running Under Graduate
program, B.E in Mechanical Engineering with an intake of 60 seats. The Department is accredited
by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) from 2012- 2015, reaccredited fromJuly 2022 to June
2025and is permanently affiliated to University of Mumbai.The Department has highly qualified and
experienced faculty members. The Department features the state-of-the-art infrastructure including
well developed laboratories, and is armed with the recent software?s. The Department imparts the
skills and expertise in the areas of Design, Thermal sciences, Manufacturing and Renewable energy
that are the backbone of Industries. The Department continuously strives to develop the technical as
well as professional skills of students by exposing them to industry environment through Industrial
Visits, Expert Lectures, Seminars Hands on Training, and Internship. The Department is associated
with SAE, ISHRAE, VMEA student chapters. The Department encourages students to understandScraped Data
real life challenges through activities like Formula Car, Quad bike, Solar Car, Electric bike
manufacturing and Aero- designing. These provide a platform for students to develop their technical,
managerial, organizational, and Communication skills by organizing workshops and by participating
in various National and International competitions. The Department also offers consultancy in the
field of Material testing, Energy Audit, ISO certification to the Industries.

Roles and responsibilities:
Program Outcomes (POs):1. Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science,
engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering
problems.2. Problem analysis: Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex
engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics,
natural sciences, and engineering sciences.3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for
complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified
needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and
environmental considerations.4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based
knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of
data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.5. Modern tool usage: Create,
select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including
prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.6.
