incessant coding followed by the pitching round. Participants have to come up with some working
prototype/solutions to address some worthy and challenging problems in these 30 hours after which
the projects are judged by a panel of judges. There is a continuous monitoring of the projects by the
jury members. Several jury rounds are conducted in these 30 hours. Experts from top companies
like Google, AWS, TCS, etc. are invited in the judging panel who validates the projects/solutions of
the participants. There has been a remarkable growth in the number of teams participating in the
