PLC Automation and Drives
:At VCET, we understand the importance of elevating student?s skills in adapting to newer
challenges and value the returns of investing in technical skill enhancement. Since last year,
Siemens Centre of excellence at VCET is established to provide training for our students in the field
of Automation & Drives. The training module encompasses a wide range of courses designed for
PLCs, Drives, Controls, HMI, Networks, Process Control, and more. Which subsequently translates
into effective, flexible, and value based training and real results in productivity, cost reductions and
process optimization. Through specific courses designed for students, each course schedule
consists of well balanced theory and provides hands-on training to optimize the knowledge about
the products. Our fleet of experienced trainers ensures that each participant makes a contribution
towards productivity and performance improvement in this organization.This centre assist students
to come up with their own new project ideas and implement them. Center is equipped with various
kits of Siemens. kits are available under three sections which are as follows:SIMATIC S7 1200 PLC
kit with HMI (A set of 6 kits package)SINAMICS G120 Trainer (set of 5 kitsSINAMICS DCM 6RA80
Trainer with DC Motors (A set of 2 kits)Students can have hands on practice on these kits and learn
